					<p>Born and raised in Australia, I am 43, live in the south-eastern suburbs
						of Melbourne close to the beach. I have been into technology from a very
						young age, sparked by the 1980‚Äôs cartoon Transformers of all things!!</p>
					<p>I work as a tech-lead for an international fin-tech company names Iress,
						prior to that I have worked as a developer, IT consultant, in marketing
						and have even owned a chain of hair salons for 13 years.</p>
					<p>Even though I work in a senior IT position, and other than extensive
						experience I have had little formal industry education or qualifications.
						As part of a professional improvement commitment, I am working on fixing
						this in view of taking on more senior positions at my current or future
						firms.</p>
					<p>I have two amazing boys and a very supportive wife, especially when I
						talk in technobabble or install overly complicated AV or lighting systems
						all over the house.</p>

				<!-- History -->
				<article id="history">
					<h2 class="major">History</h2>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/history.jpg" alt="History in
							Tech" /></span>
					<p>My interest in IT started as a child, of all things because of the
						1980‚Äôs Transformers cartoon! Going to a catholic primary school, we had
						mass each week, especially boring to a 10-year-old boy. During the sermons
						I used to daydream about how it was possible to build my own transformer,
						this led to my lifelong fascination in programming and computers.</p>
					<p>My first computer was a second-hand Commodore 64 and my Dad‚Äôs IBM 8086,
						I taught myself rudimentary BASIC on the C64 and programmed simple batch
						scripts on the PC. Whilst at school, I ran from class to class diagnosing
						problems with the Apple IIe‚Äôs and even got to program Space Invaders from
						scratch on one of them!</p>
					<p>I have operated professionally in IT, mainly in corporate or enterprise
						development since the late 90‚Äôs, have been through two dot com booms and
						busts and seen many languages, frameworks and companies rise and fall.</p>
					<p>So, after 20+ years working in IT, why a degree now? I want to move into
						upper management positions, particularly as a CTO. Providing value and
						seeing change happen, drives my work, the larger the scale I can make that
						happen, the more enriching I find my work. I need a degree to at least
						apply for these positions, however, would also like to continue to
						management post graduate degrees after completing a ComSci qualification.</p>
					<p>As part of completing my degree, I hope to round out any rough edges in
						my skill set and exit as a qualified developer. I chose RMIT due to its
						brilliant programme and progressive program and look forward to the years
						ahead.</p>

				<!-- Career -->
				<article id="career">
					<h2 class="major">Career</h2>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/career.jpg" alt="Career Plan" /></span>
					<p>The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) reports to the CEO and is a key
						member of any large and/or technology driven company. The role encumbers
						technology strategy, policy, research and development, client targeting
						and support, product development (especially for SaaS providers),
						technology finance, and a raft of other executive functions.</p>
					<p>Technological strategy, change management and uplift have always been
						exciting to me, to see uplift happen in an organisation is immensely
						rewarding, and in a CTO‚Äôs position, you‚Äôd be instilling the largest volume
						of this type of change.</p>
					<h3>CTO Position Ads</h3>
					<p>I have a included several CTO position advertisements below:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="#jobad1">Job Ad 1</a></li>
						<li><a href="#jobad2">Job Ad 2</a></li>
						<li><a href="#jobad3">Job Ad 3</a></li>
						<li><a href="#jobad4">Job Ad 4</a></li>
						<li><a href="#jobad5">Job Ad 5</a></li>
						<li><a href="#jobad6">Job Ad 6</a></li>
					</ul>
					<h3>CTO Skills Breakdown</h3>
					<p>From the positions listed above, prior research into the position and
						experience working with CTO‚Äôs and other company executives, I estimate the
						skills and qualifications to be as follows.</p>
					<p>I have included a üëç where I believe I possess the skills necessary for
						the position and a ‚ùå where I do not.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Educational qualifications
							<ul>
								<li>‚ùå Bachelor of Information Technology</li>
								<li>‚ùå Masters in Information Technology Management</li>
								<li>‚ùå Associate level certification in AWS</li>
								<li>‚ùå Agile Certified Practitioner</li>
								<li>‚ùå Other relevant certifications as they become necessary‚Ä¶</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Executive presence
							<ul>
								<li>üëç Self-motivated</li>
								<li>‚ùå Articulation ideas to technical, non-technical audiences,
									corporate and junior staff</li>
								<li>‚ùå Influencing skills</li>
								<li>üëç Collaborative and team orientated</li>
								<li>‚ùå Diplomacy skills</li>
								<li>‚ùå Negotiation skills</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Management
							<ul>
								<li>üëç 15 years work experience</li>
								<li>‚ùå 5 years in senior engineering management</li>
								<li>üëç Ability to build and retain technical teams</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Strategic skills
							<ul>
								<li>üëç Excellent planning and organisational skills</li>
								<li>üëç Demonstrated ability to understand organisational context</li>
								<li>üëç Ability to develop digital strategy and execution roadmap</li>
								<li>üëç Experience working within both large-scale, complex corporates
									and/or start-up environments</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Client and product skills
							<ul>
								<li>‚ùå Client focused</li>
								<li>‚ùå Extensive experience guiding product direction</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Technical skills
							<ul>
								<li>üëç Extensive commercial experience building applications,
									microservices and cloud tech</li>
								<li>üëç Understanding of the current and emerging global technology
									trends</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Process skills
							<ul>
								<li>üëç Experience with an agile methodology</li>
								<li>üëç Excellent analytical, evaluative, and problem-solving abilities</li>
								<li>üëç Experience leading full stack projects</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Skills Gap Strategy</h3>
					<p>Looking at the above skills gaps, I have some work to do around lifting
						my educational qualifications, executive level experience, executive
						presence, client, and product skills.</p>
					<p>Continuing educational qualifications through tertiary education and
						external management/technical certifications will close most of the
						educational gaps, taking these skills and applying them in the workplace
						will cement them.</p>
					<p>I can look to obtain executive presence through continuing to work with
						executives in organisations, personal coaching/mentoring, reading up on
						the subject and their associated skills and formal training through
						management institutes and/or an MBA qualification at a later stage.</p>
					<p>Additionally, I must continue refining my current skill set, ensuing
						that I am not subject to the <a
							rel="noopener noreferrer"
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect"
							target="_blank">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>. I can help ensure I continue
						to refine my skills through working with multiple teams and projects,
						self-education, and additional technical skill qualifications.</p>

					<h2 class="major">Profile</h2>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="My Profile" /></span>
					<p>I partook in three online surveys to collect information on my
						personality and learning style. The three tests I took were:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator located at <a
								href="https://www.16personalities.com" target="_blank">https://www.16personalities.com</a></li>
						<li>Considered by Psychology Today<sup><a href="#r1">[1]</a></sup> to have
							more accuracy and growing support than the Myers-Briggs test, a HEXACO
							personality inventory, located at <a href="http://hexaco.org"
								target="_blank">http://hexaco.org</a></li>
						<li>Although learning style tests have their critics<sup><a href="#r2">[2]</a></sup>,
							the prominent VARK learning style test at <a href="http://vark-learn.com"
								target="_blank">http://vark-learn.com</a></li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Conclusions</h2>
					<p>The test results produced what I had already known about myself, quiet,
						sociable, deterministic, equal parts process, and intuition, occasionally
						stubborn but generally thoroughly researched, with low emotional
						reactivity except where it counts. In a team setting, I am conscious of
						not dominating discussion, process, or outcomes, and try to strike a
						balance between occasional guidance and frequent collaboration. I enjoy
						working with people who can balance ambition and opinions with the needs
						of the team; many voices often lead to the best solutions.</p>
					<h2>Test Results</h2>
					<h3>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</h3>
					<p>Interestingly, the results from the Myers-Briggs test has not changed
						since I was in high school, I received a classification of INFJ-T which 16
						Personalities labels as an ‚ÄúAdvocate‚Äù:</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>The Advocate personality type is very rare, making up less than one
							percent of the population, but they nonetheless leave their mark on the
							world. Advocates have an inborn sense of idealism and morality, but what
							sets them apart is that they are not idle dreamers. These individuals are
							capable of taking concrete steps to realize their goals and make a
							lasting positive impact.</p>
						<p>People with this personality type tend to see helping others as their
							purpose in life. Advocates can often be found engaging in rescue efforts
							and doing charity work. However, their real passion is to get to the
							heart of the issue so that people need not be rescued at all.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>My personality makeup was as follows:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>78% introverted, 22% extraverted</li>
						<li>64% intuitive, 36% observant</li>
						<li>51% feeling, 49% thinking</li>
						<li>75% judging, 25% prospecting</li>
						<li>71% turbulent, 29% assertive</li>
					</ul>
					<p>To learn more about my Myers-Briggs personality type, please go to <a
							href="https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality" target="_blank">https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality</a></p>
					<h3>HEXACO Personality Inventory</h3>
					<p>The HEXACO personality inventory provided a much more detailed analysis
						of my personality type, providing a point on a range and where I sit
						relative to others on a spectrum.</p>
					<p>The results are too detailed to list here, however the main takeaways
						were:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>High on honesty and humility</li>
						<li>Low on emotionality</li>
						<li>Slightly lower than the median on extraversion</li>
						<li>Low on agreeableness, however I dispute with this üòâ</li>
						<li>Very high on conscientiousness</li>
						<li>And a low on openness to experience</li>
					</ul>
					<p>To see the results in detail please see the exported results <a
							href="assets/downloads/The HEXACO Personality Inventory - Revised.pdf"
							target="_blank">here</a> and <a
							href="assets/downloads/HEXACO-results.pdf" target="_blank">here</a></p>
					<h3>VARK learning style test</h3>
					<p>The VARK learning style test classified me as a multimodal learner,
						preferring a range of styles rather than one, trending towards visual and
						kinaesthetic learning. My result seems to reflect reality, where I will
						often watch online courses and then work through additional examples to
						cement the learning. I will resort to white papers, documentation, and
						articles where I must, however, prefer the ‚Äúwatch then do and repeat‚Äù way
						of learning.</p>
					<p>My scores were as follows:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Visual: 11</li>
						<li>Aural: 6</li>
						<li>Read/Write: 6</li>
						<li>Kinaesthetic: 13</li>
					</ul>

								<h3>Work hub application</h3>
								<h4>Motivation</h4>
								<p>Office environments have multiple ways of communicating, including
									email, IM, VoIP, etc. When these sources are intermingled with
									appointments, reminders, and tasks, it can be overwhelming to stay on
									top of key information and perform job responsibilities without
									distraction.</p>
								<p>Additionally, not every communication is equally important, or
									requires immediate attention, the University of California states that
									only 30% of email requires attention yet spend 23% of their days
									actioning email<sup><a href="#p1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
								<p>Psychology Today states that task switching can cost 40% of
									productivity<sup><a href="#p2">[2]</a></sup>, detrimentally affecting
									core job output.
									Yet,
									inaction or delay in important communications, from an awaited email
									or
									IM response, to inaction on task allocations in PM platforms, can have
									exponential flow-on effects for the teams and organisations
									productivity.</p>
								<h4>Overview</h4>
								<p>I propose developing a website that will integrate with productivity
									application APIs, and email servers, to provide a central information
									hub. The end user can consult this hub to provide a consolidated view
									of all notifications so that they can, view all important messages,
									appointments, and reminders.</p>
								<p>This website will operate as either a wallboard, or as an
									interactive dashboard, providing constant updates to the user‚Äôs
									currently assigned work items, meeting requests, and important unread
									communications.</p>
								<p>The system will also provide more generic information, such as time,
									date, news, and weather, avoiding further distractions or task
									switching.</p>
								<h4>Description</h4>
								<p>The key features of the application will be:</p>
								<h5>Appointment management</h5>
								<ul>
									<li>The application will show any currently running appointment and how
										long it has left to go</li>
									<li>The next appointment time, a countdown to the commencement of that
										appointment, and where it is</li>
									<li>A list of subsequent appointments for the rest of the day</li>
								</ul>
								<h5>Messages</h5>
								<ul>
									<li>The number of unread IM notifications for multiple providers by
										total, and from contacts regularly interacted with. Some of these IM
										providers may include Slack, Microsoft Teams, Facebook Messenger, and
										others</li>
									<li>The number of unread email messages by total, and from contacts
										regularly interacted with. Some of these email providers and
										technologies may include, POP, IMAP, Gmail, Office 365, and others</li>
								</ul>
								<h5>Development work items</h5>
								<ul>
									<li>Pull requests waiting on source code PaaS platforms. Some of these
										PaaS providers might include GitHub, Bitbucket, CodeCommit, and others</li>
									<li>Hooks into Jira to show assigned items broken up by status (e.g.
										backlog, development, testing, etc.)</li>
								</ul>
								<h5>To do items</h5>
								<ul>
									<li>Assigned and incomplete task items from SaaS task platforms. Some
										of these platforms might include Trello, Todoist, Office 365, Gmail,
										and others</li>
								</ul>
								<h5>Geo-location relevant information</h5>
								<ul>
									<li>Can be set either by the browser&rsquo;s location or manually via
										user settings</li>
									<li>The current date, time, and weather</li>
									<li>The current day&rsquo;s weather forecast</li>
									<li>The next three-day weather forecast</li>
									<li>A local and international news ticker, with configurable source
										sites, and content categories</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Security and usability will be a permanent concern for the
									application. To ensure the application is usable and desirable, the
									application will need:</p>
								<h5>Multiple layers of best-practice security</h5>
								<ul>
									<li>Allow logging in via social providers via OpenID Connect best
										practice (e.g. login with Google, Facebook, Microsoft, GitHub, etc.)</li>
									<li>The application should store no credentials unless completely
										necessary, thus authentication to SaaS and PaaS platforms should be
										through OAuth 2.0 flows, ensuring API access is done with the user's
										approval</li>
									<li>Where credential storage is needed (e.g. POP and IMAP
										synchronisation), securely storing reversibly encrypted credentials
										will be done outside the application, and in a secure HSM or
										equivalent device. Keys to the encrypted storage should be rotated on
										a regular basis and individual to the user</li>
									<li>The application should support local privacy laws, such as HIPPA,
										GDPR and ISO/IEC 27001</li>
									<li>All data synchronisation with third-party providers should be down
										outside the publicly accessible application, in a private subnet</li>
								</ul>
								<h5>Accessible on multiple devices, and by multiple user profiles</h5>
								<ul>
									<li>The site must have a reactive UI, so that the site works on
										multiple devices, of varying resolution and aspect ratios</li>
									<li>Have a touch and desktop interface, so that the functionality is
